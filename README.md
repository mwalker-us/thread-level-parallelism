# Thread Level Parallelism

This is a simple project that I did in university when I took my second systems programming class. Currently, their is a runtime error as I haven't made any changes to the code since I submitted it. I included it here as an example of a project I have done in the past for potential recruitors so they can see of my thought processes skillset.

# How to build and run
```Make
/* Makes a zip file and creates and executable named 'exec_matrix'. */
make all 

/* Creates and executable named 'matrix_exec' which you can then run. */
make exec_matrix

/* Running the application. */
./exec_matrix
```
