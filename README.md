# Thread Level Parallelism

This is a simple project that I did in university when I took my second systems programming class. Currently, there is a runtime error as I haven't made any changes to the code since I submitted it back then. I included it here as an example of a project I have done in the past for potential recruitors so they can see the thought process I go through when writing code.
